Problem Statement :

You are running an e-commerce business like Grofers. You have received n orders for the day. You have to deliver these n orders to the customers in 4 delivery slots ( 6-9, 9-13,16-19,19-23 hours). There are delivery partners who deliver these orders. Each delivery partner has their own vehicle and each vehicle has a carrying capacity i.e total weight of the orders which is dependent on the vehicle type (bike, scooter, or truck).

Bike capacity - 30 kg per trip 

Scooter capacity  - 50 kg per trip

Truck capacity - 100 kg per trip 


Each slot can take orders with an overall max weight of 100 kg. There are no trucks available in the morning slot (6-9 hours) and there are no scooters and bikes available in the evening slot (19-23 hours). All vehicle types are available for the other two slots (9-13,16-19 hours). You can’t order more than 1 truck, 3 bikes, 2 scooters a day. Also, the vehicles’ capacity should be used optimally.
